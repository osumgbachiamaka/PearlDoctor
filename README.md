# PearlDoctor
A simple web app to list possible diseases. PearlDoctor was built with Html, Css, Javascript for client 
  side rendering and Java EE for server side scripting. MySQL was used as database.
  The system has a lot of diseases and matching symptoms entered manually in it's Knowledge base.
  When a user enteres at least 3 symptoms, the system tries to match it with a possible illness.
  
 To run this app, you need to set your Java environment on your computer, your JDK, JRE and JVM.
